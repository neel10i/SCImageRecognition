Create a dashboard which allows for image recognition for various soccer clubs. The dashboard will allow 
the user to upload a file and it will attempt to recognize which club has been identified. Once identified, 
the system will provide the user with statistics regarding the club. Information will include, club name, win/loss record, 
trophies, etc. The dashboard will also include statistics about the clubs most recognizable player (opinion based).
Information such as, total number of goals/assists, total clubs, current goals/assists, current club, etc.
