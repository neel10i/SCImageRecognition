## Project Overwiew
```text
Create a dashboard which allows for image recognition for various soccer clubs. The dashboard will allow 
the user to upload a file and it will attempt to recognize which club has been identified. Once identified, 
the system will provide the user with statistics regarding the club. Information will include, club name, win/loss record, 
trophies, etc. The dashboard will also include statistics about the clubs most recognizable player (opinion based).
Information such as, total number of goals/assists, total clubs, current goals/assists, current club, etc.
```
## Technical Framework

This project will be a web-based application. In the backend side, the Flask framework will be utilized. 
```

## Data Design
```text
Data will be stored in MySQL. There will be two database tables, one called Club Information and the other will be called 
Player Information. Tentativly, there may be a third database table which will update each time the user uploads and image
and the dashboard attempts to recognize the uploaded image. Table specifications can be found below.
